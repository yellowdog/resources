# Creating a YellowDog-Ready Windows Custom Image

This README provides instructions for installing and configuring the YellowDog Agent on Windows instances to be used with Provisioned Worker Pools.

There are five steps:

1. Install CloudBase-Init (Optional - Required if running userdata scripts is desired)
2. Install the YellowDog Agent service
3. Populate the YellowDog Agent configuration file `application.yaml`
4. Create a custom image (e.g., an AWS AMI) based on the Windows instance that can be used for subsequent provisioning.
5. Register the image in a YellowDog Image Family of type `Windows`

The installation steps have been tested on Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server 2022, on instances running in AWS.

## (1) Download and Install CloudBase-Init (Optional)

**[CloudBase-Init](https://cloudbase.it/cloudbase-init/)** runs at instance boot time and is used to set various configuration details for the YellowDog Agent. It's cloud-provider-agnostic and can also be used for other, non-YellowDog, instance preparation actions.

1. Download the installer from https://www.cloudbase.it/downloads/CloudbaseInitSetup_Stable_x64.msi

2. In the directory to which the file has been downloaded, run the installer from the command line as Administrator using the following command:

```shell
msiexec /i CloudbaseInitSetup_Stable_x64.msi /passive /l*v cloudbase-init-install.log
```

Installation will show a progress bar but will not require user interaction.

## (2) Download and Install the YellowDog Agent Service

1. The current version of the YellowDog Agent installer can be downloaded from YellowDog's Nexus software repository at: https://nexus.yellowdog.tech/repository/raw-public/agent/msi/yd-agent-5.4.18.msi.

The installer includes a self-contained, minimal version of Java, required for Agent execution.

To download the latest version from the command line:

```shell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://nexus.yellowdog.tech/repository/raw-public/agent/msi/yd-agent-5.4.18.msi' -OutFile yd-agent-5.4.18.msi
```

2. In the directory to which the file has been downloaded, run the installer from the command line as Administrator:

```shell
msiexec /i yd-agent-5.4.5.msi /passive /log yd-agent-install.log YD_AGENT_METADATA_PROVIDERS=AWS,GOOGLE,OCI,AZURE,ALIBABA
```
Installation will show a progress bar but will not require user interaction.

The `YD_AGENT_METADATA_PROVIDERS` is an optional parameter which can be used to optimise the agent startup. 
Set it with the appropriate provider name(s) for your image from these options:

`AWS`, `GOOGLE`, `AZURE`, `OCI` or `ALIBABA`

## (3) Populate the YellowDog Agent Configuration File

Edit the file `C:\Program Files\YellowDog\Agent\config\application.yaml` to insert the **Task Types** that will be supported. An example populated application configuration is shown below:

```yaml
yda.taskTypes:
  - name: "cmd"
    run: "cmd.exe"
    abort: "yd_abort.bat"
  - name: "powershell"
    run: "powershell.exe"
    abort: "yd_abort.bat"

logging.pattern.console: "%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss,SSS} Worker[%10.10thread] %-5level[%40logger{40}] %message [%class{0}:%method:%line]%n"
```

Note that this will set up flexible but liberal Task Types that can execute arbitrary commands on the instance. For production use, specific custom Task Type scripts are recommended.

### Abort Handlers

If a Task is aborted before it has concluded it can leave orphan processes (etc.) running and taking up resources. To prevent this, the Task Types include an *optional* `abort:` clause, pointing to a Windows batch script that can implement appropriate clean-up steps on abort.

If the `abort:` clause is present its batch file will be called by the Agent on Task abort, and it is passed the process ID of the Task as its first and only argument. The abort batch file then assumes **all** responsibility for terminating the Task process itself and anything else that needs to be cleaned up.

The YellowDog Agent Installer supplies a default abort handler, `yd_abort.bat`. This simple handler will kill the Task process and its entire process tree, as shown below:

```
@REM This script is called by the YellowDog Agent when a Task is aborted.
@REM The Process ID of the Task is supplied as the first (and only) parameter.
@REM The script takes over all responsibility for aborting the Task and any
@REM subprocesses, etc.
@REM The script below kills the Task and its process tree.
taskkill /F /T /PID %1
```

You can add your own abort handler(s) if more sophisticated abort handling is required.

## (4) Create a Custom Image

The instance is now ready for creation of a custom image for use with YellowDog. Make a note of the ID of the custom image that is created, for use below.

## (5) Register the Image within a YellowDog Windows Image Family

- Docs: https://docs.yellowdog.co/#/the-platform/managing-images
- Portal: https://portal.yellowdog.co/#/images

The Windows custom image must be registered within a YellowDog Windows Image Family in order for it to be correctly used within Provisioned Worker Pools.

Add a Windows Image Family (named, e.g., `win-yd-agent` in namespace `win-test`), an Image Group (e.g., `v5_0_3`) and an image (e.g., `win-2022-eu-west-2`) pointing to the image ID of the custom image you've created.

In provisioning requests, the ID or name (`yd/win-test/win-yd-agent`) of the Image Family you've just created should be used, and YellowDog will then automatically select the correct image (the most recent version applicable to the cloud provider and region).
